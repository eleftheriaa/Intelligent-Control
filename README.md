**Implementing Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) from Scratch**
Topics: Actor-Critic, Maximum Entropy RL, Continuous Control
Description: Implement the SAC algorithm from scratch using PyTorch or JAX and apply
it to robotics tasks. Analyze the impact of entropy regularization, target networks, and Qfunction stability.
